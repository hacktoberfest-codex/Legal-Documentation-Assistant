## Challenges
  
Determining the type of legal document a user is asking for is a challenging task, even for experienced lawyers. We trained an AWS Comprehend Sentiment Analysis model to tackle this challenge, but it struggled to achieve the desired level of accuracy. ChatGPT, a cutting-edge AI language model, outperformed our AWS Comprehend model by a significant margin and demonstrated an uncanny ability to decipher even the most ambiguousÂ requests.
